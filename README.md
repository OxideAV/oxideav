# oxideav

Central aggregator crate for oxideav — re-exports and a prebuilt registry

Part of the [oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace) framework — a pure-Rust media transcoding and streaming stack. Codec, container, and filter crates are implemented from the spec (no C codec libraries linked or wrapped, no `*-sys` crates). Optional hardware-engine crates (`oxideav-videotoolbox` / `-audiotoolbox` / `-vaapi` / `-vdpau` / `-nvidia` / `-vulkan-video`) bridge to OS APIs via runtime `libloading`; pass `--no-hwaccel` (or omit the `hwaccel` feature) to opt out.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
oxideav = "0.0.1"
```
